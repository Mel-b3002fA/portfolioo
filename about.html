                I’m a Ukrainian front-end dev, artist and child which 
                dream it has forever been to visit Japan. Studying at a
                high school with deepened focus on physics and mathematics, I 
                pursue web development, art, content creation and volleyball in my free time. 
                Scientific topics excite me as much as creative expression and does.
                I have 3+ years of experience with frontend, most recently being 
                part of a devoted startup team. Having grown up in the far eastern part of 
                Germany for much of my 16 years of life, I call both Ukrainian and German my native 
                languages. Beyond that, I have proficiency in English[C1] and Russian[C2/native].
